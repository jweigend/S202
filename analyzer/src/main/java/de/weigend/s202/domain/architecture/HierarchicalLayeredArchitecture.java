/**
 * Concrete {@link Architecture} implementation for projects modelled as
 * a hierarchy of layered packages. Structure is Rows-of-Cols, recursive
 * through {@link Element.PackageElement}: the top-level view is a list
 * of rows (each row holds the elements at one architectural level),
 * and every nested package carries its own inner rows.
 *
 * <p>Rows are intended to be sorted from highest level (index 0) to
 * lowest. Within a row, the column order reflects the horizontal-layout
 * decision made by the rendering pipeline. The interpretation of "level"
 * (per-class vs. per-package) is the one the {@code LevelCalculator}
 * assigned to each element.
 *
 * <p>Violations are tracked at this level alongside the structure so a
 * single object answers "how does the visual look" and "what's wrong
 * with it" in one consistent snapshot.
